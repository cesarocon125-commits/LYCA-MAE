    <h2>ABOUT THE SUBJECT</h2>
    <h3>
Algebra is a branch of mathematics that
 uses letters (variables), numbers,
 and symbols to represent quantities and relationships. It helps us solve problems, 
create formulas, and understand patterns.

   <h2>WHAT I LEARNED</h2>
   <h3>In Advance College Algebra, I have gained a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts that go beyond basic equation solving. This subject strengthened my logical reasoning, problem-solving abilities, and analytical thinking. Throughout the course, I learned how to work with more complex algebraic structures and how these concepts apply to real-life situations and higher-level mathematics.<h3>

   <h2>THE THINGS I LEARNED</h2>
   <h1>In algebra, we learn many important ideas that help us understand patterns, relationships, and how to solve problems. Here are the main things we study
<h3>
1. Variables
We learn to use letters (like x and y) to represent unknown values.</h3>
<h3>
2. Expressions
We learn how to write and simplify algebraic expressions that combine numbers and variables using operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.</h3>
<h3>
3. Equations
We learn how to form and solve equations to find the value of unknown variables (e.g., 2x + 5 = 15).</h3>

<h3>
4. Inequalities
We learn how to compare quantities using symbols like <, >, ≤, and ≥, and solve inequality problems.</h3>
<h3>
5. Functions
We understand how one value depends on another and learn to use function notation (like f(x)).</h1>
<h3>
6. Graphing
We learn how to plot points, lines, and curves on a coordinate plane to visually show relationships between variables.</h1>
<h3>
7. Polynomials
We learn how to add, subtract, multiply, factor, and simplify expressions with powers of variables (e.g., x² + 3x + 2).</h3>

<h3>
8. Problem-Solving
We learn to apply algebra to real-life situations—like distances, money problems, age problems, and more.</h3>
